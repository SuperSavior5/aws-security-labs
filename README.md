Learning AWS security fundamentals while studying for Security+
# AWS Security Labs

I’m studying for Security+ and building hands-on AWS labs at the same time.  
This repo is my binder: each lab has notes + screenshots.

## Labs
- [Lab 1: Logging](lab1-logging.md)
- [Lab 2: IAM Least Privilege](lab2-iam.md)
- [Lab 3: S3 Hardening](lab3-s3.md)

## Why I’m Doing This
- To understand Security+ concepts in real AWS examples.
- To build a portfolio recruiters can see.
